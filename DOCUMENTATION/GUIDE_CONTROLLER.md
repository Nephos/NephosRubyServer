# Controller Guide

## Intern architecture

### Cookies
You can set cookies and get them via ``cookies`` in the body of any controller.

### Params
You can access to the parameters (defined by http or via the URI, based on your
routing rules).
They are accessible via ``params`` in the body of every controller.

### Hooks
You can define hooks, which are some methods, called every times, before or
after a call to a routed method. There is 2 kinds of hook actually:

- after_action
- before_action

Each of them will be called juste before or after calling the method requested.
It means that the cookies are not saved yet (so you can change them, etc.)

The hooks are defined by calling the methods ``after_action`` or
``before_action``, out of a method, usually on the top of the controller.

Hooks take 1 or 2 arguments.
- The first is the name of the method to call.
- The second, **optional**, is a hash, containing ``:only`` or ``:except``
  keys, associated to an Array or Symbol or one Symbol. Every symbols
  represents the methods triggering the hook.

**Note: If there is no 2sd argument, then the hook is triggered every times.**

**Note: except is not already implemented**

Example:
```ruby
class MainController < Nephos::Controller

  before_action :fct_before_all
  before_action :fct_before_root, only: [:root]
  after_action :fct_after_root, only: :root

  def fct_before_all
    # puts "BEFORE ALL"
  end

  def fct_before_root
    # puts "BEFORE"
  end

  def fct_after_root
    # puts "AFTER"
  end

  def root
    # puts "ROOT"
    cookies["a"] = "b"
    cookies.delete("b").to_h
    # puts "Cookies from the root:", cookies
    {
      json: {
        list: $dataset,
        add: '/add',
        rm: '/rm',
      }
    }
  end

end
```
